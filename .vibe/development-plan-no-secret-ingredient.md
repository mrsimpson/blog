# Development Plan: blog (no-secret-ingredient branch)

*Generated on 2025-09-15 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [posts](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/posts)*

## Goal
Write a blog post titled "There is no secret ingredient" about context engineering insights from a presentation, drawing parallels to Mr. Ping's revelation in Kung Fu Panda that there is no secret ingredient - it's all about getting tokens into the context.

## Discovery
### Tasks
- [ ] Research Phil Schmid's context engineering post for comparison
- [ ] Review previous blog post about responsible-vibe-mcp
- [x] Define target audience (AI engineers familiar with context engineering)
- [x] Gather Kung Fu Panda references and metaphors

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Decided on medium-form post format (500-1000 words)
- [x] Identified unique angle: Engineer's decision-making as the "secret ingredient"
- [x] Established core metaphor: Po seeing himself in the dragon scroll
- [x] Defined process memory concept and examples
- [x] Identified concrete decision-making scenarios

## Story

## Illustration
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Content is written following the story outline
- [x] Narrative flow and personal voice are consistent
- [x] Content length matches chosen format
- [x] Content stays within defined scope

### Tasks
- [x] Identify strategic locations for visual elements
- [x] Create/source Kung Fu Panda metaphor visuals
- [x] Add responsible-vibe-mcp screenshots if relevant
- [x] Ensure visual consistency and accessibility

### Completed
- [x] Integrated dragon scroll image after opening
- [x] Added soup image after ingredients section
- [x] Included bugfix workflow screenshot after process memory example
- [x] Placed no secret ingredient panda image after main revelation

## Distribution
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Visual elements are strategically placed
- [x] Visuals support and enhance written content
- [x] Visual consistency is maintained
- [x] Content is visually complete and polished

### Tasks
- [x] Optimize title and description for SEO
- [x] Review and refine tags for discoverability
- [x] Conduct final quality review
- [ ] Prepare for publishing

### Completed
- [x] Fixed typo in title ("Ingedient" → "Ingredient")
- [x] Optimized description for better SEO and clarity
- [x] Added 'kung-fu-panda' tag for metaphor discoverability
- [x] Final content review completed

## Key Decisions
- **Format**: Medium-form post (500-1000 words)
- **Core insight**: The engineer's decision-making about *when* to employ different context sources is the real "secret ingredient"
- **Primary metaphor**: Po discovering himself in the dragon scroll (Kung Fu Panda)
- **Differentiation from Phil Schmid**: While he catalogs context elements, we focus on the human decision-making layer
- **Unique contribution**: Process memory as a new context element via responsible-vibe-mcp

## Notes
- Reference Phil Schmid's work: https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering
- Build on previous blog post about responsible-vibe-mcp
- Context elements mentioned: conversation (structured via workflow), process memory, documentation, rule files, RAG results
- Key insight: Context reflects the engineer's brain through their choices

**Process Memory Details:**
- Goal-oriented memory that progresses through phases
- Managed by responsible-vibe-mcp
- Different from other context sources because it's dynamic and phase-aware

**Decision-Making Examples:**
- Engineer opts into library → LLM reads documentation via tools
- Engineer provides test cases/data later in development process
- Engineer curates conversational memory, chooses options, selects long-term memory sources
- Quality of engineer's source selection reflects in software quality

**Dragon Scroll Metaphor:**
- Po discovers the "secret" is believing in himself (no external secret ingredient)
- Engineer discovers they are the "secret ingredient" in context engineering
- The context becomes a reflection of the engineer's mind and decisions
